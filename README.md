#### Introduction
     This repository contains my solutions to NLP tasks, including regular expressions, email validation, and more.
#### Installation
     To run the NLP tasks, could you make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed? You can install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
#### Usage
     To use the regular expression function for repeated words, import it and call it with a string as input: repeated_words = find_repeated_words('Humbert Humbert and the the').
#### Examples
     example usage of find_repeated_words function
     repeated_words = find_repeated_words('Humbert Humbert and the the')
     print(repeated_words)  # Output: ['Humbert', 'the']
