# Text Preprocessing in NLP | Basic Steps to Preprocess Textual Data

Text preprocessing is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves cleaning and transforming raw text data into a format suitable for analysis and machine learning models. This process is vital for enhancing the performance and accuracy of NLP tasks.

## Key Steps in Text Preprocessing

1. *Lowercasing*:
   - Convert all text to lowercase. This ensures consistency and reduces the dimensionality of the data.

2. *Removing HTML Tags and URLs*:
   - If your text includes HTML tags or URLs, remove them. They don't contribute to the linguistic content.

3. *Removing Punctuation and Special Characters*:
   - Eliminate punctuation marks (e.g., ?, !, ,) and other non-alphanumeric characters.

4. *Handling Stop Words*:
   - Remove common stop words (e.g., "the," "and," "is") as they don't carry significant meaning.

5. *Tokenization*:
   - Split the text into individual words (tokens).

6. *Stemming and Lemmatization*:
   - Reduce words to their base or root form.
   - Stemming: Cutting off prefixes or suffixes (e.g., "running" → "run").
   - Lemmatization: Mapping words to their dictionary form (e.g., "better" → "good").

7. *Handling Emojis and Chat Words*:
   - Replace emojis with relevant text (e.g., ":)" → "happy").
   - Normalize chat abbreviations (e.g., "u" → "you").

## Example Sentence Before and After Preprocessing

Original Sentence: "The quick brown foxes are jumping over the lazy dogs."
Preprocessed Sentence: "quick brown fox jump lazy dog"

## Dataset Used in This Project

For this project, we used IMDB movie reviews. The preprocessing steps were applied to prepare the text data for further analysis.
